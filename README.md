# Caesar Cipher Python Implementation

This repository contains a Python program for implementing the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm.

## Features

- Encryption: Shifts each letter in the message by a specified amount to encrypt it.
- Decryption: Reverses the encryption process to decrypt the ciphertext back to plaintext.

## Usage

1. Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/PRODIGY_CS_Task01.git
2. Run the Program: Execute caesar_cipher.py, follow prompts to input message and shift value.
3. Explore: Experiment with different messages and shifts to observe how encryption and decryption work.

## Learning Objectives

- Gain practical experience with basic cryptography principles in Python.
- Understand how the Caesar Cipher algorithm secures messages through simple substitution.
